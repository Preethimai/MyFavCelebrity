           <br> 
           <p> Life at Rawatbhata was simple, pristine, unpolluted, far from madding rush of a city. There used to be cultural programmes and social gatherings very often. Her mother is a singer and both of her parents are very much culturally inclined and they were very much involved with all those cultural activities. During those activities, as a small child she picked up her first lessons of music. She used to hum the same songs with her immature words whatever her mother sang during rehearsals. It is during those days her potentials of singing was discovered by her parents.</p>
